<p><i>The same room. Morning, before the rehearsal. HE is striding
thoughtfully up and down the room. He wears a broad, parti-coloured
coat, and a prismatic tie. His derby is on the back of his head, and his
face is clean-shaven like that of an actor. His eyebrows are drawn, lips
pressed together energetically, his whole appearance severe and sombre.
After the entrance of the gentleman he changes. His face becomes
clown-like, mobile—a living mask.</i></p>

<p><i>The gentleman comes in. He is dressed in black, and has an extremely
well-bred appearance. His thin face is yellowish, like an invalid's.
When he is upset, his colourless, dull eyes often twitch. HE does not
notice him.</i></p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Gentleman</span></p>

<p>Good morning, sir.</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">He</span></p>

<p>[<i>Turning around and looking at him absent-mindedly</i>]: Ah! It's you.<a name="page_097" id="page_097"></a></p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Gentleman</span></p>

<p>I am not late? You look as if you did not expect me. I hope I am not
disturbing you? You fixed this time yourself however, and I took the
liberty——</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">He</span></p>

<p>No manners, please. What do you want? Tell me quickly, I have no time.</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Gentleman</span></p>

<p>[<i>Looking around with distaste</i>]: I expected you would invite me to some
other place ... to your home.</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">He</span></p>

<p>I have no other home. This is my home.</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Gentleman</span></p>

<p>But people may disturb us here.</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">He</span></p>

<p>So much the worse for you. Talk faster! [<i>Silence.</i>]</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Gentleman</span></p>

<p>Will you allow me to sit down?<a name="page_098" id="page_098"></a></p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">He</span></p>

<p>Sit down. Look out! That chair is broken.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="hang">[<i>The gentleman, afraid, pushes away the chair and looks helplessly
around. Everything here seems to him dangerous and strange. He
chooses an apparently solid little gilded divan, and sits down;
puts his silk hat aside, slowly takes off his gloves, which stick
to his fingers. HE observes him indifferently.</i>]</p></div>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Gentleman</span></p>

<p>In this suit, and with this face, you make a still stranger impression.
Yesterday it seemed to me that it was all a dream; to-day ... <i>you</i> ...</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">He</span></p>

<p>You have forgotten my name again? My name is <span class="smcap">He</span>.</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Gentleman</span></p>

<p>You are determined to continue talking to me like this?</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">He</span></p>

<p>Decidedly! But you are squandering your time like a millionaire. Hurry
up!<a name="page_099" id="page_099"></a></p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Gentleman</span></p>

<p>I really don't know.... Everything here strikes me so.... These posters,
horses, animals, which I passed when I was looking for you.... And
finally, <i>you</i>, a clown in a circus! [<i>With a slight, deprecating
smile.</i>] Could I expect it? It is true, when everybody there decided
that you were dead, I was the only man who did not agree with them. I
felt that you were still alive. But to find you among such
surroundings—I can't understand it.</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">He</span></p>

<p>You said you have a son, now. Doesn't he look like me?</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Gentleman</span></p>

<p>I don't understand?</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">He</span></p>

<p>Don't you know that widows or divorced women often have children by the
new husband, which resemble the old one? This misfortune did not befall
you? [<i>Laughs.</i>] And your book, too, is a big success, I hear.</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Gentleman</span></p>

<p>You want to insult me again?<a name="page_100" id="page_100"></a></p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">He</span></p>

<p>[<i>Laughing</i>]: What a restless, touchy faker you are! Please sit still;
be quiet. It is the custom here to speak this way. Why were you trying
to find me?</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Gentleman</span></p>

<p>My conscience....</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">He</span></p>

<p>You have no conscience. Or were you afraid that you hadn't robbed me of
<i>everything</i> I possessed, and you came for the rest? But what more could
you take from me now? My fool's cap with its bells? You wouldn't take
it. It's too big for your bald head! Crawl back, you book-worm!</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Gentleman</span></p>

<p>You cannot forgive the fact that your wife....</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">He</span></p>

<p>To the devil with my wife! [<i>The gentleman is startled and raises his
eyebrows. HE laughs.</i>]</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Gentleman</span></p>

<p>I don't know.... But such language! I confess I find difficulty in
<a name="page_101" id="page_101"></a>expressing my thoughts in such an atmosphere, but if you are so ...
indifferent to your wife, who, I shall allow myself to emphasize the
fact, loved you and thought you were a saint—— [<i>HE laughs.</i>]
Then <i>what</i> brought you to such a ... step? Or is it that you cannot
forgive me my success? A success, it is true, not entirely deserved. And
now you want to take vengeance, with your humbleness, on those who
misunderstood you. But you always were so indifferent to glory. Or your
indifference was only hypocrisy. And when I, a more lucky rival ...</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">He</span></p>

<p>[<i>With a burst of laughter</i>]: Rival! You—a rival!</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Gentleman</span></p>

<p>[Growing Pale]: But my book!</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">He</span></p>

<p>You are talking to me about <i>your</i> book? To me? [<i>The gentleman is very
pale. HE looks at him with curiosity and mockery.</i>]</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Gentleman</span></p>

<p>[<i>Raising his eyes</i>]: I am a very unhappy man.<a name="page_102" id="page_102"></a></p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">He</span></p>

<p>Why?</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Gentleman</span></p>

<p>I am a very unhappy man. You must forgive me. I am deeply, irreparably,
and infinitely unhappy.</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">He</span></p>

<p>But why? Explain it to me. [<i>Starts walking up and down.</i>] You say
yourself that your book is a tremendous success, you are famous, you
have glory; there is not a yellow newspaper in which <i>you</i> and <i>your</i>
thoughts are not mentioned. Who knows <i>me</i>? Who cares about my heavy
abstractions, from which it was difficult for them to derive a single
thought? You—you are the great vulgarizer! You have made my thoughts
comprehensible even to horses! With the art of a great vulgarizer, a
tailor of ideas, you dressed my Apollo in a barber's jacket, you handed
my Venus a yellow ticket, and to my bright hero you gave the ears of an
ass. And then your career is made, as Jackson says. And wherever I go,
the whole street looks at me with thousands of faces, in which—what
mockery—I recognize the traits of my own children. Oh! How ugly your
son must be, if he resembles me! Why then are you unhappy, you poor
devil? [<i>The gentleman bows his head, plucking at his gloves.</i>]<a name="page_103" id="page_103"></a> The
police haven't caught you, as yet. What am I talking about? Is it
possible to catch you? You always keep within the limits of the law. You
have been torturing yourself up to now because you are not married to my
wife. A notary public is always present at your thefts. What is the use
of this self-torture, my friend? Get married. I died. You are not
satisfied with having taken only my wife? Let my glory remain in your
possession. It is yours. Accept my ideas. Assume all the rights, my most
lawful heir! I died! And when I was dying [<i>making a stupidly pious
face</i>] I forgave thee! [<i>Bursts out laughing. The gentleman raises his
head, and bending forward, looks straight into HE's eyes.</i>]</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Gentleman</span></p>

<p>And my pride?</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">He</span></p>

<p>Have you any pride? [<i>The gentleman straightens up, and nods his head
silently.</i>] Yes! But please stand off a little. I don't like to look at
you. Think of it. There was a time when I loved you a little, even
thought you a little gifted! You—my empty shadow.</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Gentleman</span></p>

<p>[<i>Nodding his head</i>]: I am your shadow. [<i>HE keeps on walking, and looks
over his shoulder at the gentleman, with a smile.</i>]<a name="page_104" id="page_104"></a></p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">He</span></p>

<p>Oh, you are marvellous! What a comedy! What a touching comedy! Listen.
Tell me frankly if you can; do you hate me very much?</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Gentleman</span></p>

<p>Yes! With all the hate there is in the world! Sit down here.</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">He</span></p>

<p>You order me?</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Gentleman</span></p>

<p>Sit down here. Thank you. [<i>Bows.</i>] I am respected and I am famous, yes?
I have a wife and a son, yes. [<i>Laughs slowly.</i>] My wife still loves
you: our favourite discussion is about your genius. She supposes you are
a genius. We, I and she, love you even when we are in bed. Tss! It is I
who must make faces. My son—yes, he'll resemble you. And when, in order
to have a little rest, I go to my desk, to my ink-pot, my books—there,
too, I find you. Always you! Everywhere you! And I am never alone—never
myself and alone. And when at night—you, sir, should understand
this—when at night I go to my lonely thoughts, to my sleepless
contemplations,<a name="page_105" id="page_105"></a> even then I find your image in my head, in my
unfortunate brain, your damned and hateful image! [<i>Silence. The
gentleman's eyes twitch.</i>]</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">He</span></p>

<p>[<i>Speaking slowly</i>]: What a comedy. How marvellously everything is
turned about in this world: the robbed proves to be a robber, and the
robber is complaining of theft, and cursing! [<i>Laughs.</i>] Listen, I was
mistaken. You are not my shadow. You are the crowd. If you live by my
creations, you hate me; if you breathe my breath, you are choking with
anger. And choking with anger, hating me, you still walk slowly on the
trail of my ideas. But you are advancing backward, advancing backward,
comrade! Oh, what a marvellous comedy! [<i>Walking and smiling.</i>] Tell me,
would you be relieved if I really had died?</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Gentleman</span></p>

<p>Yes! I think so. Death augments distance and dulls the memory. Death
reconciles. But you do not look like a man who——</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">He</span></p>

<p>Yes, yes! Death, <i>certainly</i>!<a name="page_106" id="page_106"></a></p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Gentleman</span></p>

<p>Sit down here.</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">He</span></p>

<p>Your obedient servant. Yes?</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Gentleman</span></p>

<p>Certainly, I do not dare to ask you—[<i>makes a grimace</i>] to ask you to
die, but tell me: you'll never come back there? No, don't laugh. If you
want me to, I'll kiss your hand. Don't grimace! I would have done so if
you had died.</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">He</span></p>

<p>[<i>Slowly</i>]: Get out, vermin!</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="hang">[<i>Enter Tilly and Polly as in the first act, playing. For a long
time they do not see the two men.</i>]</p></div>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">He</span></p>

<p>Jack!</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Tilly</span></p>

<p>Ah! Good morning, <span class="smcap">He</span>. We are rehearsing. You know it is very hard. Jack
has just about as much music in his head as my pig.<a name="page_107" id="page_107"></a></p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">He</span></p>

<p>[<i>Introducing, nonchalantly</i>]: My friend.... For the benefit
performance? [<i>The clowns bow to the gentleman, making idiotic faces.</i>]</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Polly</span></p>

<p>Yes. What are you preparing? You are cunning, <span class="smcap">He</span>! Consuelo told me what
you are preparing for the benefit performance. She leaves us soon, you
know?</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">He</span></p>

<p>Is that so?</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Tilly</span></p>

<p>Zinida told us. Do you think she would get a benefit performance
otherwise? She is a nice girl.</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Polly</span></p>

<p>[<i>Taking his small flute-pipe</i>]: Here! Don't walk as if you were an
elephant. Don't forget you are an ant! Come on! [<i>They go off,
playing.</i>]</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Gentleman</span></p>

<p>[<i>Smiling</i>]: These are your new comrades? How strange they are!<a name="page_108" id="page_108"></a></p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">He</span></p>

<p>Everything here is strange.</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Gentleman</span></p>

<p>This suit of yours. Black used to be very becoming to you. This one
hurts the eyes.</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">He</span></p>

<p>[<i>Looking himself over</i>]: Why? It looks very nice. The rehearsal has
begun. You must go away. You are disturbing us.</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Gentleman</span></p>

<p>You did not answer my question.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="hang">[<i>Slow strains of the Tango from a small orchestra in the ring.</i>]</p></div>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">He</span></p>

<p>[<i>Listening absent-mindedly to the music</i>]: What question?</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Gentleman</span></p>

<p>[<i>Who does not hear the music</i>]: I pray you to tell me: will you ever
come back?</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">He</span></p>

<p>[<i>Listening to the music</i>]: Never, never, never!<a name="page_109" id="page_109"></a></p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Gentleman</span></p>

<p>[<i>Getting up</i>]: Thank you. I am going.</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">He</span></p>

<p>Never, never, never! Yes, run along. And don't come back. There you were
still bearable and useful for something, but here you are superfluous.</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Gentleman</span></p>

<p>But if something should happen to you ... you are a healthy man, but in
this environment, these people ... how will I know? They don't know your
name here?</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">He</span></p>

<p>My name here is unknown, but <i>you will know</i>. Anything else?</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Gentleman</span></p>

<p>I can be at peace? On your word of honour? Of course I mean,
comparatively, at peace?</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">He</span></p>

<p>Yes, you may be comparatively at peace. Never! [<i>They walk to the door,
the gentleman stops.</i>]<a name="page_110" id="page_110"></a></p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Gentleman</span></p>

<p>May I come to the circus? You will allow me?</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">He</span></p>

<p>Certainly. You are the audience! [<i>Laughs.</i>] But I shan't give you my
card for a pass. But why do you want to come? Or do you like the circus
so much, and since when?</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Gentleman</span></p>

<p>I want to look at you some more, and to understand, perhaps. Such a
transformation! Knowing you as I do, I cannot admit that you are here
without any <i>idea</i>. But what idea? [<i>Looks short-sightedly at HE. HE
grimaces and thumbs his nose.</i>]</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Gentleman</span></p>

<p>What is that?</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">He</span></p>

<p><i>My idea!</i> Good-bye, Prince! My regards to your respected wife, your
Highness' wonderful son! [<i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Mancini</span>.]</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Mancini</span></p>

<p>You positively live in the circus, <span class="smcap">He</span>. Whenever I come, you are here.
You are a fanatic in your work, sir.<a name="page_111" id="page_111"></a></p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">He</span></p>

<p>[<i>Introducing</i>]: Prince Poniatovsky, Count Mancini.</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Mancini</span></p>

<p>[<i>Drawing himself up</i>]: Very, very glad. And you too, Prince, you know
my queer fellow? What a nice face he has, hasn't he? [<i>He touches HE'S
shoulder patronizingly, with the tip of his cane.</i>]</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Gentleman</span></p>

<p>[<i>Awkwardly</i>]: Yes, I have the pleasure ... certainly. Good-bye, Count.</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Mancini</span></p>

<p>Good-day, Prince.</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">He</span></p>

<p>[<i>Accompanying him</i>]: Look out, your Highness, for the dark passages:
the steps are so rotten. Unfortunately I cannot usher you out to the
street.</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Gentleman</span></p>

<p>[<i>In a low voice</i>]: You will not give me your hand when we say good-bye?
We are parting for ever.<a name="page_112" id="page_112"></a></p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">He</span></p>

<p>Unnecessary, Prince. I shall still hope to meet you in the Kingdom of
Heaven. I trust you will be there, too?</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Gentleman</span></p>

<p>[<i>With disgust</i>]: How you did succeed! You have so much of the clown in
you!</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">He</span></p>

<p>I am <span class="smcap">He</span> Who is Getting Slapped. Good-bye, Prince. [<i>They take another
step.</i>]</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Gentleman</span></p>

<p>[<i>Looking HE in the eyes; in a very low voice</i>]: Tell me, you are not
mad?</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">He</span></p>

<p>[<i>Just at low, his eyes wide open</i>]: I am afraid, I am afraid you are
right, Prince. [<i>Still low</i>] Ass! Never in your life did you use such a
precise expression. I am mad!</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="hang">[<i>Playing the clown again, he shows him to the stair, with a big,

<p><a name="page_113" id="page_113"></a></p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">He</span></p>

<p>[<i>Laughing</i>]: He is down! <i>Au revoir</i>, Prince. [<i>The gentleman goes out.
HE comes skipping back, and takes a pose.</i>] Mancini! Let us dance the
Tango! Mancini, I adore you!</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Mancini</span></p>

<p>[<i>Sitting back comfortably and playing with his cane</i>]: Don't forget
yourself, <span class="smcap">He</span>. But you're hiding something, my boy. I always said you
used to belong to society. It is so easy to talk to you. And who is this
Prince? A genuine one?</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">He</span></p>

<p>Genuine. A first-rater. Like you!</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Mancini</span></p>

<p>A sympathetic face. Although at first I thought he was an undertaker who
came for an order. Ah, <span class="smcap">He</span>! When shall I finally depart from these dirty
walls, from Papa Briquet, stupid posters, and brutal jockeys!</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">He</span></p>

<p>Very soon, Mancini.<a name="page_114" id="page_114"></a></p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Mancini</span></p>

<p>Yes, soon. I am simply exhausted in these surroundings, <span class="smcap">He</span>! I begin to
feel myself a horse. You are from society, still you don't yet know what
high society means. To be at last decently dressed, to attend
receptions, to display the splendour of wit; from time to time to have a
game of baccarat [<i>laughing</i>] without tricks or cheating——</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">He</span></p>

<p>And when evening comes, go to a suburb, where you are considered an
honest father, who loves his children and——</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Mancini</span></p>

<p>And get hold of something, eh? [<i>Laughs.</i>] I shall wear a silk mask and
two butlers shall follow me, thus protecting me from the dirty crowd.
Ah, <span class="smcap">He</span>! The blood of my ancestors boils in me. Look at this stiletto.
What do you think? Do you think that it was ever stained with blood?</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">He</span></p>

<p>You frighten me, Count!</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Mancini</span></p>

<p>[<i>Laughing, and putting the stiletto back into its sheath</i>]: Fool!<a name="page_115" id="page_115"></a></p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">He</span></p>

<p>And what about the girl?</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Mancini</span></p>

<p>Tss! I give those bourgeois absolute satisfaction, and they glorify my
name. [<i>Laughs.</i>] The splendour of my name is beginning to shine with a
force unknown. By the way, do you know what automobile firms are the
best? Money is no object. [<i>Laughs.</i>] Ah! Papa Briquet!</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="hang">[<i>Enter Briquet in his overcoat and silk hat. They shake hands.</i>]</p></div>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Briquet</span></p>

<p>So, Mancini, you have obtained a benefit performance for your daughter,
Consuelo! I only want to tell you, that if it were not for Zinida....</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Mancini</span></p>

<p>Listen, Briquet. Decidedly you are a donkey. What are you complaining
of? The Baron has bought all the parquet seats for Consuelo's benefit
performance. Isn't that enough for you, you miser?</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Briquet</span></p>

<p>I love your daughter, Mancini, and I am sorry to let her go. What more
does she need here? She has<a name="page_116" id="page_116"></a> an honest job, wonderful comrades, and the
atmosphere—?</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Mancini</span></p>

<p>Not <i>she</i>, but <i>I</i> need something. You understand? [<i>Laughs.</i>] I asked
you to increase her salary, Harpagon! and now, Mr. Manager, wouldn't you
like to change me a thousand franc note?</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Briquet</span></p>

<p>[<i>With a sigh</i>]: Give it to me.</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Mancini</span></p>

<p>[<i>Nonchalantly</i>]: To-morrow. I left it at home. [<i>All three laugh.</i>]
Laugh, laugh! To-day we are going with the Baron to his villa in the
country; people say a very nice villa.</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">He</span></p>

<p>What for?</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Mancini</span></p>

<p>You know, <span class="smcap">He</span>, the crazes of these billionaires. He wants to show
Consuelo some winter roses, and me his wine cellars. He will come for us
here. What is the matter, my little Consuelo?</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="hang">[<i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Consuelo</span>, <i>almost crying</i>.]</p></div>

<p><a name="page_117" id="page_117"></a></p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Consuelo</span></p>

<p>I can't father! Tell him! What right has he to yell at me? He almost hit
me with his whip!</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Mancini</span></p>

<p>[<i>Straightening up</i>]: Briquet! I beg of you, as the Manager, what is
this—a stable? To hit my daughter with a whip! I'll show this cub ... a
mere jockey.... No, the devil knows what it is, devil knows, I swear....</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Consuelo</span></p>

<p>Father....</p>

<p>I will tell him.</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Consuelo</span></p>

<p>Please don't. Alfred didn't hit me. It's a silly thing, what I told you.
What an idea! He is so sorry himself....</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Briquet</span></p>

<p>I shall tell him anyhow that——</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Consuelo</span></p>

<p>Don't you dare. You mustn't tell him anything. He didn't do a thing.<a name="page_118" id="page_118"></a></p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Mancini</span></p>

<p>[<i>Still excited</i>]: He must beg her pardon, the brat.</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Consuelo</span></p>

<p>He's already asked me to forgive him. How silly you all are! I simply
cannot work to-day and I got nervous. What nonsense! The silly boy asked
me to forgive him, but I didn't want to. <span class="smcap">He</span>, dear, good morning! I
didn't notice you. How becoming your tie is! Where are you going,
Briquet? To Alfred?</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Briquet</span></p>

<p>No, I am going home, dear child. Zinida asked me to give you her love.
She will not be here to-day, either. [<i>He goes out.</i>]</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Consuelo</span></p>

<p>Zinida is so nice, so good. Father, why is it that everybody seems so
nice to me? Probably because I am going away soon. <span class="smcap">He</span>, did you hear the
march that Tilly and Polly will play? [<i>Laughs.</i>] Such a cheerful one.</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">He</span></p>

<p>Yes. I heard it. Your benefit performance will be remarkable.<a name="page_119" id="page_119"></a></p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Consuelo</span></p>

<p>I think so, too. Father I am hungry. Have them bring me a sandwich.</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">He</span></p>

<p>I'll run for it, my Queen.</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Consuelo</span></p>

<p>Yes, a little. Oh, I am so hungry.</p>

<p>Oh, the devil ... what a memory I have. [<i>Laughs.</i>] But we shall have a

your superfluous simplicity. You become more of a woman.</p>

<p>Am I so simple, Father?</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Mancini</span></p>

<p>Very.... Too much. I like it in others, but not in you. Besides, the
Baron....</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Consuelo</span></p>

Jim says he's bound to break his neck. Poor fish....</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Mancini</span></p>

<p>[<i>Indifferently</i>]: Or his leg, or his back; they all have to break
something. [<i>Laughs.</i>] They are breakable toys.</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Mancini</span></p>

<p>A ring? [<i>Laughs.</i>] No, it's not a lie. By the way, child, when speaking
of Barons, you must say, "he does not tell the truth," and not, "he
lies."</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Consuelo</span></p>

<p>It's just the same. It's nice to be wealthy, Father; you can do what you

<p>[<i>Indifferently</i>]: Yes?</p>

<p>Alfred! Your Alfred is a cub, and he mustn't dare. But with men of that

his lap.</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Consuelo</span></p>

<p>Foui! Father, what are you talking about? You should be ashamed!</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Mancini</span></p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Consuelo</span></p>

<p>Don't you dare! I don't want to hear such dirty things. I shall give the
Baron such a slap! A better one than <span class="smcap">He</span>—let him only try.</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Mancini</span></p>

<p>[<i>With a deprecating gesture</i>]: All men are like that, child.</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Consuelo</span></p>

<p>It isn't true. Alfred is not. Ah! But where is <span class="smcap">He</span>? He said he'd run, and
he hasn't come back.</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Mancini</span></p>

<p>The buffet here is closed, and he has to get the sandwiches somewhere
else. Consuelo, as your father, I want to warn you about <span class="smcap">He</span>. Don't trust
him. He knows something. [<i>Twirls his finger close to his forehead.</i>]
His game is not fair.</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Consuelo</span></p>

<p>Eat, Consuelo.</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Consuelo</span></p>

<p>A hot one.... But you were running, <span class="smcap">He</span>? I am so grateful. [<i>Eats.</i>] <span class="smcap">He</span>,

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">He</span></p>

<p>I do, my Queen. I am your court fool.</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Consuelo</span></p>

<p>[<i>Eating</i>]: And when I leave, will you find another queen?</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">He</span></p>

<p>[<i>Making a ceremonious bow</i>]: I shall follow after you, my incomparable
one. I shall carry the train of your dress and wipe away my tears with
it. [<i>Pretends to cry.</i>]<a name="page_126" id="page_126"></a></p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Mancini</span></p>

<p>Idiot! [<i>Laughs.</i>] How sorry I am, <span class="smcap">He</span>, that those wonderful times have
passed, when, in the court of the Counts Mancini, there were scores of
motley fools who were given gold and kicks.... Now, Mancini is compelled
to go to this dirty circus in order to see a good fool; and still, whose
fool is he? Mine? No. He belongs to everybody who pays a franc. We shall
very soon be unable to breathe because of Democracy. Democracy, too,
needs fools! Think of it, <span class="smcap">He</span>; what an unexampled impertinence.</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">He</span></p>

<p>We are the servants of those who pay. But how can we help it, Count?</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Mancini</span></p>

<p>But is that not sad? Imagine: we are in my castle. I, near the fireplace
with my glass of wine, you, at my feet chatting your nonsense, jingling
your little bells—diverting me. Sometimes you pinch me too with your
jokes: it is allowed by the traditions and necessary for the circulation
of the blood. After a while—I am sick of you, I want another one....
Then I give you a kick and.... Ah, <span class="smcap">He</span>, how wonderful it would be!<a name="page_127" id="page_127"></a></p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">He</span></p>

<p>It would be marvellous, Mancini!</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Mancini</span></p>

<p>Yes. Certainly! You would be getting gold coins, those wonderfully
little yellow things.... Well, when I become rich, I shall take you.
That's settled.</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Consuelo</span></p>

<p>Take him, Father....</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">He</span></p>

<p>And when the count, tired of my chattering, will give me a kick with his
Highness's foot, then I shall lie down at the little feet of my queen,
and shall....</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Consuelo</span></p>

<p>[<i>Laughing</i>]: Wait for another kick? I'm finished. Father, give me your
handkerchief, I want to wipe my hands. You have another one in your
pocket. Oh, my goodness, I must work some more!</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Mancini</span></p>

<p>[<i>Uneasy</i>]: But don't forget, my child!<a name="page_128" id="page_128"></a></p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Consuelo</span></p>

<p>No, to-day I won't forget! Go on!</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Mancini</span></p>

<p>[<i>Looking at his watch</i>]: Yes, it is time.... He asked me to come over
when you were ready. You must change your dress before I come back.

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Consuelo</span></p>

<p>Hello, <span class="smcap">He</span>! Come and lie down at my feet, and tell me something
cheerful.... You know, when you paint the laughter on your face, you are
very good looking, but now, too, you are very, very nice. Come on, <span class="smcap">He</span>,
why don't you lie down?</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">He</span></p>

<p>Consuelo! Are you going to marry the Baron?</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Consuelo</span></p>

<p>[<i>Indifferently</i>]: It seems so. The Baron is hanging by a thread! <span class="smcap">He</span>,
there is one little sandwich left. Eat it.<a name="page_129" id="page_129"></a></p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">He</span></p>

<p>Thank you, my queen. [<i>Eats.</i>] And do you remember my prediction?</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Consuelo</span></p>

<p>What prediction? How quickly you swallow! Does it taste good?</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">He</span></p>

<p>Very good. That if you marry the Baron, you....</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Consuelo</span></p>

<p>Oh, that's what you're talking about.... But you were making fun.</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">He</span></p>

<p>Nobody can tell, my Queen. Sometimes one makes fun, and suddenly it
turns out to be true; the stars never talk in vain. If sometimes it is
difficult for a human being to open his mouth and to say a word, how
difficult it must be for a star. Think of it.</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Consuelo</span></p>

<p>[<i>Laughing</i>]: I should say. Such a mouth! [<i>Makes a tiny mouth.</i>]<a name="page_130" id="page_130"></a></p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">He</span></p>

<p>No, my dear little girl, were I in your place, I would think it over.
And suppose suddenly you should die? Don't marry the Baron, Consuelo!</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Consuelo</span></p>

<p>[<i>Thinking</i>]: And what is—death?</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">He</span></p>

<p>I do not know, my Queen. Nobody knows. Like love! Nobody knows. But your
little hands will become cold, and your dear little eyes will be closed.
You will be away from here. And the music will play without you, and
without you the crazy Bezano will be galloping, and Tilly and Polly will
be playing on their pipes without you: tilly-polly, tilly-polly ...
tilly-tilly, polly-polly....</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Consuelo</span></p>

<p>Please don't, <span class="smcap">He</span> darling—— I am so sad, anyway ... tilly-tilly,
polly-polly ... [<i>Silence. HE looks at</i> <span class="smcap">Consuelo</span>.]</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">He</span></p>

<p>You were crying, my little Consuelo?<a name="page_131" id="page_131"></a></p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Consuelo</span></p>

<p>Yes, a little. Alfred made me nervous. But tell me, is it my fault that
I can't do anything to-day? I tried to, but I couldn't.</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">He</span></p>

<p>Why?</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Consuelo</span></p>

<p>Ah, I don't know. There is something here. [<i>Presses her hand against
her heart.</i>] I don't know. <span class="smcap">He</span>, I must be sick. What is sickness? Does it
hurt very much?</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">He</span></p>

<p>It is not sickness. It is the charm of the far off stars, Consuelo. It
is the voice of your fate, my little Queen.</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Consuelo</span></p>

<p>Don't talk nonsense, please. What should the stars care about me? I am
so small. Nonsense, <span class="smcap">He</span>! Tell me rather another tale which you know:
about the blue sea and those gods, you know ... who are so beautiful.
Did they all die?<a name="page_132" id="page_132"></a></p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">He</span></p>

<p>They are all alive, but they hide themselves, my goddess.</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Consuelo</span></p>

<p>In the woods or mountains? Can one come across them? Ah, imagine <span class="smcap">He</span> ...
I come across a god, and he suddenly takes a look at me! I'd run away.
[<i>Laughs.</i>] This morning when I went without breakfast, I became so sad,
so disgusted, and I thought: if a god should come, and give me something
to eat! And as I thought it, I suddenly heard, honestly it's true, I
heard: "Consuelo, somebody's calling you." [<i>Angrily.</i>] Don't you dare
laugh!</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">He</span></p>

<p>Am I laughing?</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Consuelo</span></p>

<p>Honestly, it's true. Ah, <span class="smcap">He</span>, but he didn't come. He only called me and
disappeared, and how can you find him? It hurt me so much, and hurts
even now. Why did you remind me of my childhood? I'd forgotten it
entirely. There was the sea ... and something ... many, many [<i>closes
her eyes, smiling.</i>]</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">He</span></p>

<p>Remember, Consuelo.<a name="page_133" id="page_133"></a></p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Consuelo</span></p>

<p>No. [<i>Opening her eyes</i>] I forget everything about it. [<i>Looks around
the room.</i>] <span class="smcap">He</span>, do you see what a poster they made for my benefit

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Consuelo</span></p>

<p>Why? [<i>After a silence.</i>] How fresh you are, <span class="smcap">He</span>.</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">He</span></p>

<p>[<i>Lowering his head, slowly</i>]: I don't want it.</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Consuelo</span></p>

<p>[<i>Getting up</i>]: What? You don't want it?</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">He</span></p>

<p>[<i>Bowing his head still lower</i>]: I do not want you to marry the Baron
[<i>Imploring.</i>] I ... I shall not allow it ... I beg you!</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Consuelo</span></p>

<p>Whom, then, would you ask me to marry? You, perhaps, you fool? [<i>With a
rancorous laugh</i>] Are<a name="page_134" id="page_134"></a> you crazy, my darling? "I shall not allow." <span class="smcap">He!</span>
<span class="smcap">He</span> will not allow me! But it is unbearable! What business is it of
yours? [<i>Walking up and down the room, looks over her shoulder at HE,
with anger.</i>] Some fool clown, whom they can kick out of here any
minute. You make me sick with your stupid tales. Or you like slaps so
much. Fool, you couldn't invent anything better than a slap!</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">He</span></p>

<p>[<i>Without lifting his head</i>]: Forgive me, my Queen.</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Consuelo</span></p>

<p>He is glad when they laugh at him. Some god! No, I shan't forgive. I
know you. [<i>Makes same gesture as</i> <span class="smcap">Mancini</span>.] You have something there!
Laughs ... so nicely ... plays, plays, and then suddenly—hop! <i>Obey
him!</i> No, darling, I am not that kind! Carry my train, that is your

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">He</span></p>

<p>I shall carry your train, my Queen. Forgive me. Give me back the image

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">He</span></p>

<p>I see everything, my Queen. I see how beautiful you are, and how low
under your feet your poor court fool is lying. Somewhere in the abyss
his little bells are ringing. He kneels before you and prays; forgive
and pity him, my divine one. He was too impudent; he played so
cheerfully that he went too far and lost his tiny little mind, the last
bit of understanding he had saved up. Forgive me!</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Consuelo</span></p>

<p>All right. I forgive you. [<i>Laughs.</i>] And now will you allow me to marry
the Baron?</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">He</span></p>

<p>[<i>Also laughing</i>]: And nevertheless I will not allow it. But what does a
queen care about the permission of her enamoured fool?<a name="page_136" id="page_136"></a></p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Consuelo</span></p>

<p>Get up. You are forgiven. And do you know why? You think because of your
words? You are a cunning beast, <span class="smcap">He</span>! No, because of the <i>sandwiches</i>.
That's why. You were so lovely, you panted so when you brought them.
Poor darling <span class="smcap">He</span>. From to-morrow you may be at my feet again. And as soon
as I whistle, "tuwhooo"——</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">He</span></p>

don't see the web, which is woven in every dark corner. Get out of the
vicious circle in which you are turning around, like a blind man. Take
her away, steal her, do what you want ... kill her even, and take her to
the heavens or to the devil! But don't give her to this man! He is a
defiler of love. And if you are timid, if you are afraid to lift your
hand against her—kill the Baron! Kill!</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Bezano</span></p>

<p>[<i>With a smile</i>]: And who will kill the others, to come?</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">He</span></p>

<p>She loves you.</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Bezano</span></p>

<p>Did she tell you that herself?</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">He</span></p>

<p>What a petty, what a stupid, what a human pride! But <i>you</i> are a little
god! A god, youth! Why<a name="page_140" id="page_140"></a> don't you want to believe me? Or does the
street, from which I have come, bother you? But look, look yourself.
Look in my eyes, do such eyes lie? Yes, my face is ugly, I make faces
and grimaces, I am surrounded by laughter, but don't you see the god
behind all this, a god, like you? Look, look at me! [<span class="smcap">Bezano</span> <i>bursts out
laughing</i>.] What are you laughing at, youth?</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Bezano</span></p>

<p>You look now as you did that evening in the ring. You remember? When you
were a great man, and they sent for you from the Academy, and
suddenly—Hup! <span class="smcap">He</span> Who Gets Slapped!</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">He</span></p>

<p>[<i>Laughing the same way</i>]: Yes, yes, you are right, Bezano. There is a
resemblance. [<i>With a strained expression, taking a pose</i>] "It seems to
me they sent for me from the Academy!"</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Bezano</span></p>

<p>[<i>Displeased</i>]: But I don't like this play. You can present your face
for slaps if you want to, but don't dare to expose mine. [<i>Turns to
go.</i>]</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">He</span></p>

<p>Bezano!<a name="page_141" id="page_141"></a></p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Bezano</span></p>

<p>[<i>Turning round</i>]: And never let me hear any more about Consuelo, and
don't dare to tell me again that I am a god! It is disgusting.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="hang">[<span class="smcap">Bezano</span> <i>goes out angrily, striking his boot with his whip. HE is

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">He</span></p>

<p>[<i>Bowing low, with a large gesture</i>]: How do you do, Baron? My humblest
respects to you, Count. I beg your pardon, Count, but you found the
clown at work. These are, so to speak, Baron, his every-day pleasures.</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Mancini</span></p>

<p>[<i>Lifting his eyebrows</i>]: Tsss. But you are a clever man, <span class="smcap">He</span>. I shall

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">He</span></p>

<p>Please do me the favour, Count.</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Mancini</span></p>

<p>Don't overdo. Be more simple, <span class="smcap">He</span>. [<i>Laughs.</i>] But how many slaps will
you get at your benefit performance, when even on weekdays they ring you
like a gong! A funny profession, isn't it, Baron?</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Baron</span></p>

<p>Very strange. But where is the Countess?</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Mancini</span></p>

<p>Yes, yes. I shall go for her at once. Dear child, she is so absorbed in
her benefit performance and her work. They call this jumping <i>work</i>,
Baron.</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Baron</span></p>

<p>I can wait a little. [<i>Sits down, with his silk hat on his head.</i>]</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Mancini</span></p>

<p>But why? I shall hurry her up. I shall be back at once. And you, <span class="smcap">He</span>, be
a nice host, and entertain our dear guest. You will not be bored in his
company, Baron.<a name="page_143" id="page_143"></a></p>
