<p><i>A very large, rather dirty room, with whitewashed walls. To the left,
in a niche, is a window, the only outside window in the room, opening on
a court-yard. The light from it is so dim that even by day the
electricity has to be turned on.</i></p>

<p><i>At the very top of the centre-back wall is a row of small dusty
windows. They open on the circus hall. At night, when the performance is
going on, a bright light shines through. By day they are dark. In the
same wall is a large white door, reached by two stone steps, and nailed
fast.</i></p>

<p><i>On the right, almost in the corner, is a high, wide, arched doorway
which leads to the stables and the ring. By day it opens into pale
darkness, at night into pale light.</i></p>

<p><i>The room is used for many purposes. It is the office of Papa Briquet,
manager of the circus; here he keeps his little desk. It is the
cloak-room of some of the actors. It is also the room where the cast
gathers between calls, during rehearsals or performances. Again, it is a
check-room for used circus property, such as gilt<a name="page_004" id="page_004"></a> armchairs, scenery
for pantomimes, and other wares of the circus household. The walls are
covered with circus announcements and glaring posters.</i></p>

<p><i>The time is morning. In the circus hall a rehearsal is going on, and
preparations are being made for the evening performance. As the curtain
goes up, the cracking whip and the shouts of the riding-master are heard
from the ring. The stage is empty for a few seconds, then enter Tilly
and Polly, the musical clowns, practising a new march. Playing on tiny
pipes, they step from the dark doorway to the window. Their music is
agreeable to the ear, but small, mincing, artificially clown-like, like
their mincing steps; they wear jackets and resemble each other; same
smooth-shaven face, same height; Tilly, the younger, has a scarf around
his neck; both have their derbies on the backs of their heads. Tilly
glances through the window, then they turn about, still marching.</i></p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Polly</span></p>

<p>[<i>Interrupting the march</i>]: Stop, you're out again! Now, listen—[<i>He
stands close to Tilly and plays into his face. Tilly absent-mindedly
listens, scratching his nose.</i>] There! Come on now! [<i>They resume their
music and marching. As they reach the door they meet the manager and</i>
<span class="smcap">Mancini</span>; <i>the latter walks behind the manager, and is gnawing at the
knob of his goldmounted<a name="page_005" id="page_005"></a> cane</i>. <span class="smcap">Count Mancini</span> <i>is tall and slight. The
seams of his clothes are worn and he keeps his coat buttoned tight. He
assumes extremely graceful manners, takes affected poses, and has a
special fondness for toying with his cane, with aristocratic
stylishness. When he laughs, which happens often, his thin sharp face
takes on a marked resemblance to a satyr. The manager</i>, <span class="smcap">"Papa" Briquet</span>,
<i>is a stout quiet man of average height</i>. <i>His bearing is hesitant. The
clowns make room for the gentlemen. The manager looks questioningly at
the older man.</i>]</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Polly</span></p>

<p>[<i>With an affected accent</i>]: Our moosic for the pantomime! The March of
the Ants!</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Briquet</span></p>

<p>Ha! Yes!</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="hang">[<i>The gentlemen walk in. The clowns resume their music</i>, <span class="smcap">Polly</span>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Polly</span></p>

<p>Papa Briquet, Jack is working very badly to-day.</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Briquet</span></p>

<p>What's the matter with him?<a name="page_006" id="page_006"></a></p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Polly</span></p>

<p>He has a sore throat. You'd better take a look at him.</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Briquet</span></p>

<p>All right. Come on, Jack. Open your mouth! Wider—wider. [<i>Turns clown's
face to the light near the window and examines him closely and
seriously.</i>] Just smear it with iodine.</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Polly</span></p>

<p>I told him so. I said it was nothing! Oh! Come on. [<i>They go away
playing, marching, practising their funny mincing steps. The manager
sits down.</i> <span class="smcap">Mancini</span> <i>strikes a pose by the wall, smiling ironically.</i>]</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Mancini</span></p>

<p>So. You give them medical treatment, too! Look out, Papa Briquet, you
have no licence.</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Briquet</span></p>

<p>Just a little advice. They're all so afraid for their lives.</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Mancini</span></p>

<p>His throat is simply burnt with whiskey. These<a name="page_007" id="page_007"></a> two fellows get drunk
every night. I am amazed, Papa Briquet, to see you pay so little
attention to their morals. [<i>He laughs.</i>]</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Briquet</span></p>

<p>You make me sick, Mancini.</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Mancini</span></p>

<p>Count Mancini is at your service!</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Briquet</span></p>

<p>You make me sick, Count Mancini. You poke your nose into everything, you
disturb the artists in their work. Some day you'll get a thrashing, and
I warn you that I shan't interfere.</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Mancini</span></p>

<p>As a man of superior associations and education I cannot be expected to
treat your actors as my equals! What more can you ask, Briquet? You see
that I do you the honour of speaking with you quite familiarly, quite
simply.</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Briquet</span></p>

<p>Ha! ha! ha! [<i>Slightly threatening</i>] Really!—<a name="page_008" id="page_008"></a></p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Mancini</span></p>

<p>Never mind my joke. What if they did dare attack me—ever seen this,
Briquet? [<i>He draws a stiletto out of his cane and advances it
silently.</i>] Useful little thing. By the way, you have no idea of the
discovery I made yesterday in a suburb. Such a girl! [<i>Laughs.</i>] Oh,
well! all right, all right—I know you don't like that sort of sport.
But look here, you must give me a hundred francs!</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Briquet</span></p>

<p>Not a sou.</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Mancini</span></p>

<p>Then I'll take away Consuelo—that's all——</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Briquet</span></p>

<p>Your daily threat!</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Mancini</span></p>

<p>Yes, my threat! And you would do the same, if you were as shamefully
hard up as I am. Now look here, you know as well as I do that I have to
live up to my name somehow, keep up the family reputation. Just because
the tide of ill-fortune which struck my ancestors compelled me to make
my daughter, the<a name="page_009" id="page_009"></a> Countess Veronica, a bareback rider—to keep us from
starving—do you understand—you heartless idiot!</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Briquet</span></p>

<p>You chase the girls too much! Some day you'll land in jail, Mancini!</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Mancini</span></p>

<p>In jail? Oh, no! Why, I have to uphold our <i>name</i>, the splendour of my
family, [<i>laughs</i>] haven't I? The Mancinis are known all over Italy for
their love of girls—just girls! Is it my fault if I must pay such crazy
prices for what my ancestors got free of charge? You're nothing but an
ass, a <i>parvenu</i> ass. How can you understand Family Traditions? I don't
drink—I stopped playing cards after that accident—no, you need not
smile. Now if I give up the girls, what will be left of Mancini? Only a
coat of arms, that's all—— In the name of family traditions,
give me a hundred francs!</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Briquet</span></p>

<p>I told you no, I won't.</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Mancini</span></p>

<p>You know that I leave half of the salary for Consuelo<a name="page_010" id="page_010"></a>—but—perhaps you
think I do not love my child—my only daughter, all that remains to me
as a memory of her sainted mother—what cruelty! [<i>Pretends to cry,
wipes his eyes with a small and dirty lace handkerchief, embroidered
with a coronet.</i>]</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Briquet</span></p>

<p>Why don't you say, rather, that she is foolish enough to give you half
her salary. You make me sick——</p>

<p>[<i>Enter Zinida, the lion tamer; burningly beautiful, her self-confident,
commanding gestures at first glance give an impression of languor. She
is</i> <span class="smcap">Briquet's</span> <i>unmarried wife.</i>]</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Zinida</span></p>

<p>[<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Mancini</span>]: Good morning.</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Mancini</span></p>

<p>Madame Zinida! This barbarian, this brute may pierce me with his dagger,
but I cannot control the expression of my love! [<i>Kneels facetiously
before her</i>] Madame! Count Mancini has the honour of asking you to be
his wife....</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Zinida</span></p>

<p>[<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Briquet</span>]: Money?<a name="page_011" id="page_011"></a></p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Briquet</span></p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Zinida</span></p>

<p>Don't give him any. [<i>Sits down wearily on a torn sofa, shuts her eyes.
<span class="smcap">Mancini</span> gets up and wipes his knees.</i>]</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Mancini</span></p>

<p>Duchess! Don't be cruel. I am no lion, no tiger, no savage beast which
you are accustomed to tame. I am merely a poor domestic animal, who
wants, miaow, miaow, a little green grass.</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Zinida</span></p>

<p>[<i>Without opening her eyes</i>]: Jim tells me you have a teacher for
Consuelo. What for?</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Mancini</span></p>

<p>The solicitude of a father, duchess, the solicitude and the tireless
anxiety of a loving heart. The extreme misfortunes of our family, when I
was a child, have left some flaws in her education. Friends, the
daughter of Count Mancini, Countess Veronica, can barely read! Is that
admissible? And you, Briquet, heartless brute, you still ask why I need
money!<a name="page_012" id="page_012"></a></p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Zinida</span></p>

<p>Artful!</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Briquet</span></p>

<p>What are you teaching her?</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Mancini</span></p>

<p>Everything. A student had been giving her lessons, but I threw him out
yesterday. He had the nerve to fall in love with Consuelo and stood
there miaowing at the door like a cat. Everything, Briquet, that you
don't know—literature, mythology, orthography——</p>

<p>[<i>Two young actresses appear, with small fur coats thrown over their
light dresses. They are tired and sit down in the corner.</i>]</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Mancini</span></p>

<p>I do not wish my daughter——</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Zinida</span></p>

<p>Artful!</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Briquet</span></p>

<p>You are stupid, Mancini. What do you do it for? [<i>In a didactic tone</i>]
You are fearfully stupid, Mancini. Why does she need to learn? Since she
is here<a name="page_013" id="page_013"></a> she need never know anything about that life. Don't you
understand? What is geography? If I were the government I would forbid
artists to read books. Let them read the posters, that's enough.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="hang">[<i>During</i> <span class="smcap">Briquet's</span> <i>speech, the two clowns and another actor
enter. They sit down wearily.</i>]</p></div>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Briquet</span></p>

<p>Right now, your Consuelo is an excellent artist, but just as soon as you
teach her mythology, and she begins to read, she'll become a nuisance,
she'll be corrupted, and then she'll go and poison herself. I know those
books, I've read 'em myself. All they teach is corruption, and how to
kill oneself.</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">First Actress</span></p>

<p>I love the novels that come out in the newspaper.</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Briquet</span></p>

<p>That shows what a foolish girl you are. You'll be done for in no time.
Believe me, my friends, we must forget entirely what is happening out
there. How can we understand all that goes on there?</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Mancini</span></p>

<p>You are an enemy of enlightenment, you are an obscurantist, Briquet.<a name="page_014" id="page_014"></a></p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Briquet</span></p>

<p>And you are stupid. You are from out there. What has it taught you?
[<i>The actors laugh.</i>] If you'd been born in a circus as I was, you'd
know something. Enlightenment is plain nonsense—nothing else. Ask
Zinida. She knows everything they teach out there—geography,
mythology—— Does it make her any happier? You tell them, dear.</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Zinida</span></p>

<p>Leave me alone, Louis.</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Mancini</span></p>

<p>[<i>Angrily</i>]: Oh! Go to the devil! When I listen to your asinine
philosophy, I'd like to skin you for more than a paltry hundred
francs—for two hundred—for a thousand. Great God! What an ass of a
manager! Yes, right before every one of them I want to say that you are
a stingy old skinflint—that you pay starvation wages. I'll make you
give Consuelo a raise of a hundred francs. Listen, all you honest
vagabonds, tell me—who is it draws the crowd that fills the circus
every night? You? a couple of musical donkeys? Tigers, lions? Nobody
cares for those hungry cats!</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Zinida</span></p>

<p>Leave the tigers alone.<a name="page_015" id="page_015"></a></p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Mancini</span></p>

<p>Beg your pardon, Zinida. I did not mean to hurt your feelings—honestly.
I really marvel at your furious audacity—at your grace—you are a
heroine—I kiss your tiny hands. But what do they understand about
heroism? [<i>An orchestra softly plays the Tango in the circus. He
continues with enthusiasm.</i>] Hear! hear! Now tell me, honest vagabonds,
who but Consuelo and Bezano draws the crowds! That Tango on
horseback—it is—it is—— Oh, the devil! Even his fatuousness
the Pope could not withstand its lure.</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Polly</span></p>

<p>True! It's a great trick—wasn't the idea Bezano's?</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Mancini</span></p>

<p>Idea! Idea! The lad's in love, like a cat—that's the idea. What's the
good of an idea without a woman! You wouldn't dance very far with your
idea alone, eh, Papa Briquet?</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Briquet</span></p>

<p>We have a contract.</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Mancini</span></p>

<p>Such base formalities.<a name="page_016" id="page_016"></a></p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Zinida</span></p>

<p>Give him ten francs and let him go.</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Mancini</span></p>

<p>Ten! Never! <i>Fifteen!</i> Don't be stubborn, Papa. For the traditions of my
house—twenty. I swear—on my honour—I can't do with less. [<span class="smcap">Briquet</span>
<i>hands him twenty francs. Nonchalantly</i>] <i>Merci.</i> Thanks.</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Zinida</span></p>

<p>Why don't you take it from your baron?</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Mancini</span></p>

<p>[<i>Raising his eyebrows haughtily, quite indignant</i>]: From the Baron?
Woman! who do you think I am that I should be beholden to a stranger?</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Zinida</span></p>

<p>You're plotting something artful. I know you very little, but I guess
you're an awful scoundrel.</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Mancini</span></p>

<p>[<i>Laughs</i>]: Such an insult from such beautiful lips.</p>

<p>Papa Briquet, there's a gentleman from beyond the grave asking for you.</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Actress</span></p>

<p>A ghost?</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Athlete</span></p>

<p>No. He seems alive. Did you ever see a drunken ghost?</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Briquet</span></p>

<p>If he's drunk, tell him I'm out, Thomas. Does he want to see me or the
Count?</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Athlete</span></p>

<p>No, you. Maybe he's not drunk, but just a ghost.</p>

<p>[<i>Controlling herself</i>]: One should not torture another as you torture
me. Alfred, I love you. No, I do not command. Look into my eyes—— <i>I
love you.</i> [<i>Silence.</i>]</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Bezano</span></p>

<p>[<i>Turns to go</i>]: Good-bye.<a name="page_046" id="page_046"></a></p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Zinida</span></p>

<p>Alfred——</p>

<p>[<span class="smcap">He</span> <i>appears in the doorway, and stops</i>.]</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Bezano</span></p>

<p>Please never tell me any more that you love me. I don't want it.
Otherwise I will quit. You pronounce the word love as if you were
cracking me with your whip. You know it is disgusting——</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">He</span></p>

<p>[<i>Coming in</i>]: I beg your pardon, but I——</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Zinida</span></p>

<p>There you are again, poking your nose into everything, <span class="smcap">He</span>. Do you really
want a slap?</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">He</span></p>

<p>[<i>Laughing</i>]: No. I simply forgot my overcoat. I didn't hear anything.<a name="page_047" id="page_047"></a></p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Zinida</span></p>

<p>I don't care whether you did or not.</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">He</span></p>

<p>May I take my coat?</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Zinida</span></p>

<p>Take it if it's yours. Sit down, <span class="smcap">He</span>.</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">He</span></p>

<p>I am sitting down.</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Zinida</span></p>

<p>Now tell me <span class="smcap">He</span>, could you love me?</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">He</span></p>

<p>[<i>Laughing</i>]: I? I and Love! Look at me, Zinida. Did you ever see a
lover with such a face?</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Zinida</span></p>

<p>One can succeed with such a face——</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">He</span></p>

<p>That's because I am happy—because I lost my hat—because I am drunk—or
perhaps I am not drunk.<a name="page_048" id="page_048"></a> But I feel as dizzy as a young girl at her
first ball. It is so nice here—slap me, I want to play my part. Perhaps
it will awaken love in my heart, too. Love—[<i>as if listening to his own
heart with pretended terror</i>] do you know—I feel it!</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Zinida</span></p>

<p>[<i>Listening too</i>]: For me?</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">He</span></p>

<p>No. I don't know. For everyone. [<i>Listens to the music.</i>] Yes, they are
dancing—how beautiful Consuelo is—and how beautiful is the youth. He
has the body of a Greek God; he looks as if he had been modeled by
Praxiteles. Love! Love! [<i>Silence, music.</i>.]</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Zinida</span></p>

<p>Tell me, <span class="smcap">He</span>——</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">He</span></p>

<p>At your service, Queen!</p>
