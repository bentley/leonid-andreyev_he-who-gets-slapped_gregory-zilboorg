<p><i>The same room, during the evening performance. Occasional music,
laughter, shrieks, and applause are audible. Through the small windows,
back centre, the light is shining.</i></p>

<p><i>Consuelo and Baron Regnard occupy the stage; Consuelo wears her stage
costume; she sits with her feet on the sofa, a small shawl covering her
shoulders. Before her stands the Baron, a tall stout man in evening
dress, a rose in his button-hole; grasping the ground with feet well
apart, he gazes at her with convex spider-like eyes.</i></p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Baron</span></p>

<p>Is it true that your father, the Count, has introduced you to a certain
Marquis Justi, a very rich man?</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Consuelo</span></p>

<p>[<i>Surprised</i>]: No, he is only joking. I have often heard him speak of a
Marquis Justi but I have never seen him——</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Baron</span></p>

<p>And do you know that your father is just a charlatan?<a name="page_050" id="page_050"></a></p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Consuelo</span></p>

<p>Oh! Don't say that—Father is such a dear.</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Baron</span></p>

<p>Did you like the jewels?</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Consuelo</span></p>

<p>Yes, very much. I was very sorry when Father told me I must return them.
He said it would not be nice for me to keep them. I even cried a little
about it.</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Baron</span></p>

<p>Your father is only a beggar and a charlatan.</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Consuelo</span></p>

<p>Oh, no, don't scold him—he loves you so much.</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Baron</span></p>

<p>Let me kiss your hand——</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Consuelo</span></p>

<p>Oh, no, it isn't proper! One may kiss the hand only when one says how do
you do or good-bye. But in the meantime you can't.<a name="page_051" id="page_051"></a></p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Baron</span></p>

<p>Everybody is in love with you, that is why you and your father make such
a fuss about yourselves. Who is that new clown they call <span class="smcap">He</span>? I don't
like him, he's too shrewd a beast.... Is he in love with you, too? I
noticed the way he looked at you....</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Consuelo</span></p>

<p>[<i>Laughing</i>]: Nothing of the kind. He is so funny! He got fifty-two
slaps yesterday. We counted them. Think of it, fifty-two slaps! Father
said, "if they had only been gold pieces."</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Baron</span></p>

<p>And Bezano, Consuelo.... Do you like him?</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Consuelo</span></p>

<p>Yes, very much. He is so good-looking. He says that Bezano and I are the
most beautiful couple in the world. <span class="smcap">He</span> calls him Adam, and me Eve. But
that's improper, isn't it? <span class="smcap">He</span> is <i>so</i> improper.</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Baron</span></p>

<p>And does <span class="smcap">He</span> speak to you very often?<a name="page_052" id="page_052"></a></p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Consuelo</span></p>

<p>Yes, often.... But I don't understand him. It seems as if he were drunk.</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Baron</span></p>

<p>"Consuelo"!... It means in Spanish ... Consolation. Your father is an
ass.... Consuelo, I love you.</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Consuelo</span></p>

<p>Talk it over with Father.</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Baron</span></p>

<p>[<i>Angry</i>]: Your father is a swindler and a charlatan. He should be
turned over to the police. Don't you understand that I <i>cannot</i> marry
you?</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Consuelo</span></p>

<p>But Father says you can....</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Baron</span></p>

<p>No, I cannot. And what if I shoot myself? Consuelo, silly girl, I love
<a name="page_053" id="page_053"></a>you unbearably ... unbearably, do you understand? I am probably mad ...
and must be taken to a doctor, yanked about, beaten with sticks. Why do
I love you so much, Consuelo?</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Consuelo</span></p>

<p>Then, you'd better marry.</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Baron</span></p>

<p>I have had a hundred women, beauties, but I didn't see them. You are the
first and I don't see any one else. Who strikes man with love, God or
the Devil? The Devil struck me. Let me kiss your hand.</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Consuelo</span></p>

<p>No. [<i>She thinks a while and sighs.</i>]</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Baron</span></p>

<p>Do you think sometimes? What are you thinking about now Consuelo?</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Consuelo</span></p>

<p>[<i>With another sigh</i>]: I don't know why, I just felt sorry for Bezano.
[<i>Sighs again.</i>] He is so nice to me when he teaches me ... and he has
such a tiny little room.</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Baron</span></p>

<p>[<i>Indignant</i>]: You were there?<a name="page_054" id="page_054"></a></p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Consuelo</span></p>

<p>No. He told me about it. [<i>Smiling</i>] Do you hear the noise in there?
That's <span class="smcap">He</span> getting slapped. Poor thing ... although I know it doesn't
hurt, it's only make-believe. The intermission is coming soon.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="hang">[<i>The</i> <span class="smcap">Baron</span> <i>throws away his cigar, takes two quick steps forward,
and falls on his knees before the girl</i>.]</p></div>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Baron</span></p>

<p>Consuelo——</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Consuelo</span></p>

<p>Please, don't. Get up. Please leave my hand alone.</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Baron</span></p>

<p>Consuelo!</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Consuelo</span></p>

<p>[<i>Disgusted</i>]: Get up please, it's disgusting—you're so fat.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="hang">[<i>The</i> <span class="smcap">Baron</span> <i>gets up. Voices are heard near the door and in the
ring. It is the intermission. The clowns come first, talking
cheerfully and excitedly. He leads them, in his clown's dress,
with<a name="page_055" id="page_055"></a> painted eyebrows and white nose; the others are applauding
him. Voices of the actors calling: "Bravo! <span class="smcap">He</span>." Then come the
actors and actresses, riding-masters, and the rest, all in costume.

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Polly</span></p>

<p>A hundred slaps! Bravo, <span class="smcap">He</span>!</p>

<p>Not bad, not bad at all. You'll make a career.</p>

<p>He was the Professor to-day, and we were the students. Here goes
another! [<i>Gives him a clown's slap. Laughter. All bid good evening to
the <span class="smcap">Baron</span>. He is politely rude to these vagabonds who bore him, and
remains silent. They seem quite used to it. Enter <span class="smcap">Mancini</span>. He is the
same, and with the same cane.</i>]</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Mancini</span></p>

<p>[<i>Shaking hands</i>]: What a success, Baron—and think of it—how the crowd
does love slaps. [<i>Whispering</i>] Your knees are dusty, Baron, brush them
off. The floor is very dirty in here. [<i>Aloud</i>] Consuelo,<a name="page_056" id="page_056"></a> dear child,
how do you feel? [<i>Goes over to his daughter. Sound of laughing,
chattering. The waiters from the buffet in the lobby bring in soda and
wine. Consuelo's voice it heard.</i>]</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Consuelo</span></p>

<p>And where is Bezano?</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">He</span></p>

<p>[<i>Bows before the</i> <span class="smcap">Baron</span>, <i>affecting intimacy</i>]: <i>You</i> do not recognize
me, Baron?</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Baron</span></p>

<p>Yes I do. You are the clown, <span class="smcap">He</span>.</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">He</span></p>

<p>Yes I am <span class="smcap">He</span> Who Gets Slapped. May I presume to ask you, Baron, did you
get your jewels back?</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Baron</span></p>

<p>What!</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">He</span></p>

<p>I was asked to return some jewels to you, and I take the liberty of——
[<i>The</i> <span class="smcap">Baron</span> <i>turns his back on him—<span class="smcap">He</span> laughs loudly</i>.]<a name="page_057" id="page_057"></a></p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Jackson</span></p>

<p>Whiskey and soda! Believe me, ladies and gents, <span class="smcap">He</span> will surely make a
career. I am an old clown, and I know the crowd. Why to-day, he even
eclipsed <i>me</i>—and clouds have covered my Sun. [<i>Striking it.</i>] They do
not like puzzles, they want slaps! They are longing for them and
dreaming about them in their homes. Your health, <span class="smcap">He</span>! Another whiskey and
soda! <span class="smcap">He</span> got so many slaps to-day, there would be enough to go round the
whole orchestra!</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Tilly</span></p>

<p>I bet there wouldn't! [<i>To Jackson</i>] Shake!</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Polly</span></p>

<p>I bet there wouldn't—I'll go and count the old mugs.</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">A Voice</span></p>

<p>The orchestra did not laugh——</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Jackson</span></p>

<p>Because they were getting it, but the galleries did, because they were
looking at the orchestra getting slapped. Your health, <span class="smcap">He</span>!<a name="page_058" id="page_058"></a></p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">He</span></p>

<p>Your's Jim! Tell me, why didn't you let me finish my speech—I was just
getting a good start.</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Jackson</span></p>

<p>[<i>Seriously</i>]: My friend, because your speech was a sacrilege.
Politics—all right. Manners—as much as you want. But Providence—leave
it in peace. And believe me, friend, I shut your mouth in time. Didn't
I, Papa Briquet?</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Briquet</span></p>

<p>[<i>Coming nearer</i>]: Yes. It was too much like literature. This is not an
academy. You forget yourself, <span class="smcap">He</span>.</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Tilly</span></p>

<p>But to shut one's mouth—faugh....</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Briquet</span></p>

<p>[<i>In a didactic tone</i>]: Whenever one shuts one's mouth, it is always
high time to shut it, unless one is drinking. Hey, whiskey and soda!</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Voices</span></p>

<p>Whiskey and soda for the Manager!<a name="page_059" id="page_059"></a></p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Mancini</span></p>

<p>But this is obscurantism. Philosophizing again, Briquet?</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Briquet</span></p>

<p>I am not satisfied with you to-day, <span class="smcap">He</span>. Why do you tease them? They
don't like it. Your health! A good slap must be clean like a
crystal—fft-fft! right side, left side, and done with it. They will
like it; they will laugh, and love you. But in your slaps there is a
certain bite, you understand, a certain smell——</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">He</span></p>

<p>But they laughed, nevertheless!</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Briquet</span></p>

<p>But without pleasure, without pleasure, <span class="smcap">He</span>. You pay, and immediately
draw a draft on their bank; it's not the right game—they won't like
you.</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Jackson</span></p>

<p>That's what <i>I</i> tell him. He had already begun to make them angry.</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Bezano</span></p>

<p>[<i>Entering</i>]: Consuelo, where are you? I have been looking for you—come
on. [<i>Both go out. The</i><a name="page_060" id="page_060"></a> <span class="smcap">Baron</span>, <i>after hesitating a while, follows
them</i>. <span class="smcap">Mancini</span> <i>accompanies him respectfully to the door</i>.]</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">He</span></p>

<p>[<i>Sighs</i>]: You don't understand, my dear friends; you are simply old,
and have forgotten the smell of the stage.</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Jackson</span></p>

<p>Aha! Who is old, my young man?</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">He</span></p>

<p>Don't be angry, Jim. It's a play, don't you understand? I become happy
when I enter the ring and hear the music. I wear a mask and I feel
humorous. There is a mask on my face, and I play. I may say <i>anything</i>
like a drunkard. Do you understand? Yesterday when I, with this stupid
face, was playing the great man, the philosopher [<i>he assumes a proud
monumental pose, and repeats the gesture of the play—general laughter</i>]
I was walking this way, and was telling how great, how wise, how
incomparable I was—how God lived in me, how high I stood above the
earth—how glory shone above my head [<i>his voice changes and he is
speaking faster</i>] then you, Jim, you hit me for the first time. And I
asked you, "What is it, they're applauding me?" Then, at the<a name="page_061" id="page_061"></a> tenth
slap, I said: "It seems to me that they sent for me from the Academy?"
[<i>Acts, looking around him with an air of unconquerable pride and
splendour. Laughter. Jackson gives him a real slap.</i>]</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">He</span></p>

<p>[<i>Holding his face</i>]: Why?</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Jackson</span></p>

<p>Because you're a fool, and play for nothing. Waiter, the check.
(<i>Laughter. The bell calls them to the ring. The actors go out in haste,
some running. The waiters collect their money.</i>)</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Briquet</span></p>

<p>[<i>In a sing-song</i>]: To the ring—to the ring—</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Mancini</span></p>

<p>I want to tell you something, <span class="smcap">He</span>. You are not going yet?</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">He</span></p>

<p>No. I'll take a rest.</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Briquet</span></p>

<p>To the ring—to the ring—</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="hang">[<i>The clowns as they go sing in shrill, squeaky voices. Little by
little they all disappear, and loud<a name="page_062" id="page_062"></a> music begins. <span class="smcap">He</span> seats himself
on the sofa with his legs crossed, and yawns.</i>]</p></div>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Mancini</span></p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">He</span>, you have something none of my ancestors ever had—money. Let's have
a nice bottle on you. Waiter, please—[<i>The waiter who was taking up
dishes, brings a bottle of wine and glasses and goes out.</i>]</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">He</span></p>

<p>You're blue, Mancini. [<i>Stretches.</i>] Well, at my age, a hundred
slaps—it seems pretty hard. So you're blue. How are things getting on
with your girl?</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Mancini</span></p>

<p>Tss! Bad! Complications—parents—[<i>shudders</i>] Agh—</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">He</span></p>

<p>Prison!</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Mancini</span></p>

<p>[<i>Laughing</i>]: Prison! Mustn't I uphold the glory of my name now, eh? <span class="smcap">He</span>,
I'm joking—but there is Hell in my heart. You're the only one who
understands<a name="page_063" id="page_063"></a> me. But tell me how to explain this passion? It will turn
my hair grey, it'll bring me to prison, to the grave. I am a tragic man.
<span class="smcap">He</span>—[<i>Wipes his eyes with a dirty handkerchief.</i>] Why don't I like
things which are not forbidden? Why, at all moments, even at the very
moment of ecstasy, must I be reminded of some law—it is stupid. <span class="smcap">He</span>, I
am becoming an anarchist. Good God!—Count Mancini, an anarchist. That's
the only thing I've missed.</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">He</span></p>

<p>Isn't there a way of settling it somehow?</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Mancini</span></p>

<p>Is there a way of getting money, somehow?</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">He</span></p>

<p>And the Baron?</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Mancini</span></p>

<p>Oh, yes! He's just waiting for it, the bloodsucker! He'll get what he's
after. Some day, you'll see me give him Consuelo for ten thousand
francs, perhaps for five!</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">He</span></p>

<p>Cheap.<a name="page_064" id="page_064"></a></p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Mancini</span></p>

<p>Did I say it was anything else? Do I want to do it? But these bourgeois
are strangling me, they've got me by the throat. <span class="smcap">He</span>, one can easily see
that you're a gentleman, and of good society, you understand me—I
showed you the jewels which I sent back to him—damn honesty—I didn't
even dare change the stones, put false ones—</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">He</span></p>

<p>Why?</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Mancini</span></p>

<p>It would have queered the game. Do you think he didn't weigh the
diamonds when he got them back?</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">He</span></p>

<p>He will not marry her.</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Mancini</span></p>

<p>Yes he will. You don't understand. [<i>Laughs.</i>] The first half of his
life, this man had only appetites—now love's got him. If he does not
get Consuelo, he is lost, he is—like a withered narcissus. Plague take
him with his automobiles. Did you see his car?<a name="page_065" id="page_065"></a></p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">He</span></p>

<p>I did.... Give Consuelo to the Jockey—</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Mancini</span></p>

<p>To Bezano? [<i>Laughs.</i>] What nonsense you do talk! Oh, I know. It's your
joke about Adam and Eve. But please stop it. It's clever, but it
compromises the child. She told me about it.</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">He</span></p>

<p>Or give her to me.</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Mancini</span></p>

<p>Have you a billion? [<i>Laughs.</i>] Ah, <span class="smcap">He</span>, I'm not in the proper mood to
listen to your clownish jokes—They say there are terrible jails in this
country, and no discriminations are being made between people of my
kind, and plain scoundrels. Why do you look at me like that? You're
making fun of me?</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">He</span></p>

<p>No.</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Mancini</span></p>

<p>I'll never get accustomed to those faces. You're so disgustingly made
up.<a name="page_066" id="page_066"></a></p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">He</span></p>

<p>He will not marry her. You can be as proud as you please, Mancini, but
he'll not marry her. What <i>is</i> Consuelo? She is not educated. When she
is off her horse, any good housemaid from a decent house has nicer
manners, and speaks better. [<i>Nonchalantly</i>] Don't <i>you</i> think she's
stupid?</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Mancini</span></p>

<p>No, she's not stupid. And you, <span class="smcap">He</span>, are a fool. What need has a woman of
intelligence? Why, <span class="smcap">He</span>, you astonish me. Consuelo is an unpolished jewel,
and only a real donkey does not notice her sparkle. Do you know what
happened? I tried to begin to polish her—</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">He</span></p>

<p>Yes, you took a teacher. And what happened?</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Mancini</span></p>

<p>[<i>Nodding his head</i>]: I was frightened—it went too fast—I had to
dismiss him. Another month or two, and <i>she</i> would have kicked <i>me</i> out.
[<i>Laughs.</i>] The clever old diamond merchants of Amsterdam keep their
precious stones unpolished, and fool the thieves. My father taught me
that.<a name="page_067" id="page_067"></a></p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">He</span></p>

<p>The sleep of a diamond. It is only sleeping, then. You are wise,
Mancini.</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Mancini</span></p>

<p>Do you know what blood flows in the veins of an Italian woman? The blood
of Hannibal and Corsini—of a Borgia—and of a dirty Lombardi
peasant—and of a Moor. Oh! an Italian woman is not of a lower race,
with only peasants and gypsies behind her. All possibilities, all forms
are included in her, as in our marvelous sculpture. Do you understand
that, you fool? Strike here—out springs a washerwoman, or a cheap
street girl whom you want to throw out, because she is sloppy and has a
screechy voice. Strike there—but carefully and gently, for there stands
a queen, a goddess, the Venus of the Capitol, who sings like a
Stradivarius and makes you cry, idiot! An Italian woman—</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">He</span></p>

<p>You're quite a poet, Mancini! But what will the Baron make of her?</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Mancini</span></p>

<p>What? What? Make of <i>her</i>? A baroness, you fool! What are you laughing
at? I don't get you?<a name="page_068" id="page_068"></a> But I am happy that this lovesick beast is neither
a duke nor a prince—or she would be a princess and I—what would become
of me? A year after the wedding they would not let me even into the
kitchen [<i>laughing</i>] not even into the kitchen! I, Count Mancini, and
she a—a simple—</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">He</span></p>

<p>[<i>Jumping up</i>]: What did you say? You are not her father, Mancini?</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Mancini</span></p>

<p>Tss—the devil—I am so nervous to-day! Heavens, who do you think I am?
"Her father?" Of course [<i>tries to laugh</i>] how silly you are—haven't
you noticed the family resemblance? Just look, the nose, the
eyes—[<i>Suddenly sighs deeply.</i>] Ah, <span class="smcap">He</span>! How unhappy I am! Think of it.
Here I am, a gentleman, nearly beaten in my struggle to keep up the
honour of my name, of an old house, while there in the parquet—there
sits that beast, an elephant with the eyes of a spider ... and he looks
at Consuelo ... and....</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">He</span></p>

<p>Yes, yes, he has the motionless stare of a spider—you're right!<a name="page_069" id="page_069"></a></p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Mancini</span></p>

<p>Just what I say—a spider! But I must, I shall compel him to marry her.
You'll see—[<i>Walking excitedly up and down, playing with his cane.</i>]
You'll see! All my life I've been getting ready for this battle. [<i>He
continues to walk up and down. Silence. Outside, great stillness.</i>]</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">He</span></p>

<p>[<i>Listening</i>]: Why is it so quiet out there? What a strange silence.</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Mancini</span></p>

<p>[<i>Disgusted</i>]: I don't know. Out there it is quiet—but here [<i>touching
his forehead with his cane</i>] here is storm, whirlwind. [<i>Bends over the
clown.</i>] <span class="smcap">He</span>, shall I tell you a strange thing—an unusual trick of

<p>I didn't see. I had closed my eyes, and didn't open them. Alfred says
she is a wicked woman, but that isn't true. She has such nice eyes, and
what tiny cold hands—as if she were dead. What does she do it for?

<p>Yes, Consuelo. And if the Baron asks you to be his wife, will you

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Consuelo</span></p>

<p>Certainly, <span class="smcap">He</span>. That's all Father and I are waiting for. Father told me
yesterday that the Baron will not hesitate very long. Of course I do not
love him. But I will be his honest, faithful wife. Father wants to teach

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">He</span></p>

<p>Are those your own words—"his honest, faithful wife"?</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Consuelo</span></p>

<p>Certainly they are mine. Whose could they be? He loves me so much, the

love—love—Zinida, too! Poor Zinida! What a boring evening this has
been! <span class="smcap">He</span>, did you paint the laughter on your face yourself?<a name="page_083" id="page_083"></a></p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">He</span></p>

<p>My own self, dear little Consuelo——</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Consuelo</span></p>

<p>How do you do it, all of you? I tried once, but couldn't do a thing. Why
are there no women clowns? Why are you so silent, <span class="smcap">He</span>? You, too, are sad,
to-night.</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">He</span></p>

<p>No, I am happy to-night. Give me your hand, Consuelo, I want to see what
it says.</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Consuelo</span></p>

<p>Do you know how? What a talented man you are! Read it, but don't <i>lie</i>,
like a gypsy. [<i>He goes down on one knee and takes her hand. Both bend

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">He</span></p>

<p>Yes, lucky. But wait a minute—this line here—funny. Ah, Consuelo, what
does it say, here! [<i>Acting</i>] I tremble, my eyes do not dare to read the
strange, fatal signs. Consuelo—</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Consuelo</span></p>

<p>The stars are talking.<a name="page_084" id="page_084"></a></p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">He</span></p>

<p>Yes, the stars are talking. Their voices are distant and terrible; their
rays are pale, and their shadows slip by, like the ghosts of dead
virgins—their spell is upon thee, Consuelo, beautiful Consuelo. Thou
standest at the door of Eternity.</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Consuelo</span></p>

<p>I don't understand. Does it mean that I will live long?</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">He</span></p>

<p>This line—how far it goes. Strange! Thou wilt live eternally, Consuelo.</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Consuelo</span></p>

<p>You see, <span class="smcap">He</span>, you did tell me a lie, just like a gypsy!</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">He</span></p>

<p>But it is written—here, silly—and here. Now think of what the stars
are saying. Here you have eternal life, love, and glory; and here,
listen to what Jupiter says. He says: "Goddess, thou must not belong to
any one born on earth," and if you marry the Baron—you'll perish,
you'll die, Consuelo. [<i>Consuelo laughs.</i>]<a name="page_085" id="page_085"></a></p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Consuelo</span></p>

<p>Will he eat me?</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">He</span></p>

<p>No. But you will die before he has time to eat you.</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Consuelo</span></p>

<p>And what will become of Father? Is there nothing about him here?
[<i>Laughing, she softly sings the melody of the waltz, which is playing
in the distance.</i>]</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">He</span></p>

<p>Don't laugh, Consuelo, at the voice of the stars. They are far away,
their rays are light and pale, and we can barely see their sleeping
shadows, but their sorcery is stern and dark. You stand at the gates of
eternity. Your die is cast; you are <i>doomed</i>—and your Alfred, whom you
love in your heart, even though your mind is not aware of it, your
Alfred cannot save you. He, too, is a stranger on this earth. He is
submerged in a deep sleep. He, too, is a little god who has lost
himself, and Consuelo, never, never will he find his way to Heaven
again. Forget Bezano——</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Consuelo</span></p>

<p>I don't understand a word. Do the gods really exist? My teacher told me
about them. But I<a name="page_086" id="page_086"></a> thought it was all tales! [<i>Laughs.</i>] And my Bezano
is a god?</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">He</span></p>

<p>Forget Bezano! Consuelo, do you know who can save you? The only one who
can save you? I.</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Consuelo</span></p>

<p>[<i>Laughing</i>]: You, <span class="smcap">He</span>?</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">He</span></p>

<p>Yes, but don't laugh! Look. Here is the letter H. It is I, <span class="smcap">He</span>.</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Consuelo</span></p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">He</span> Who Gets Slapped? Is that written here, too?</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">He</span></p>

<p>That, too. The stars know everything. But look here, what more is
written about him. Consuelo, welcome him. <span class="smcap">He</span> is an old god in disguise,
who came down to earth only to love you, foolish little Consuelo.</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Consuelo</span></p>

<p>[<i>Laughing and singing</i>]: Some god!<a name="page_087" id="page_087"></a></p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">He</span></p>

<p>Don't mock! The gods don't like such, empty laughter from beautiful
lips. The gods grow lonely and die, when they are not recognized. Oh,
Consuelo! Oh, great joy and love! Do recognize this god, and accept him.
Think a moment, one day a god suddenly went crazy!</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Consuelo</span></p>

<p>Gods go crazy, too?</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">He</span></p>

<p>Yes, when they are half man, then they often go mad. Suddenly he saw his
own sublimity, and shuddered with horror, with infinite solitude, with
super-human anguish. It is terrible, when anguish touches the divine
soul!</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Consuelo</span></p>

<p>I don't like it. What language are you speaking? I don't understand——</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">He</span></p>

<p>I speak the language of thy awakening. Consuelo, recognize and accept
thy god, who was thrown down from the summit like a stone. Accept the
god who fell<a name="page_088" id="page_088"></a> to the earth in order to live, to play, and to be
infinitely drunk with joy. Evoë Goddess!</p>

of God, which gives harmony, light, and love to the world? Do not the

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">He</span></p>

<p>I am <span class="smcap">He</span> Who Gets Slapped!<a name="page_091" id="page_091"></a></p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Consuelo</span></p>

<p>You are not angry because I struck you? I did not want to really, but
you were so—disgusting. And now you are so funny again. You have great
talent, <span class="smcap">He</span>—or are you drunk?</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">He</span></p>

<p>Strike me again.</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Consuelo</span></p>

<p>No.</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">He</span></p>

<p>I need it for my play. Strike!</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Consuelo</span></p>

<p>[<i>Laughs, and touches his cheek with her fingertips</i>]: Here, then!</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">He</span></p>

<p>Didn't you understand that you are a queen, and I a fool who is in love
with his queen? Don't you know, Consuelo, that every queen has a fool,
and he is always in love with her, and they always beat him for it. <span class="smcap">He</span>
Who Gets Slapped.<a name="page_092" id="page_092"></a></p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Consuelo</span></p>

<p>No. I didn't know.</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">He</span></p>

<p>Yes, every queen. Beauty has her fool. Wisdom, too. Oh, how many fools
she has! Her court is overcrowded with enamoured fools, and the sound of
slaps does not cease, even through the night. But I never received such
a sweet slap as the one given by my little queen. [<i>Someone appears at
the door.</i> <span class="smcap">He</span> <i>notices it, and continues to play, making many faces</i>.]
Clown <span class="smcap">He</span> can have no rival! Who is there who could stand such a deluge
of slaps, such a hail-storm of slaps, and not get soaked? [<i>Feigns to
cry aloud.</i>] "Have pity on me. I am but a poor fool!"</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="hang">[<i>Enter two men: an actor, dressed as a bareback rider, and a
gentleman from the audience. He is spare, dressed in black, very

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Consuelo</span></p>

<p>[<i>Laughing, embarrassed</i>]: <span class="smcap">He</span>, there is someone here. Stop!</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">He</span></p>

<p>[<i>Gets up</i>]: Who is it? Who dares to intrude in the castle of my queen?<a name="page_093" id="page_093"></a></p>

<p>[<i>HE stops, suddenly. Consuelo, laughing, jumps up and runs away, after
a quick glance at the gentleman.</i>]</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Consuelo</span></p>

<p>You cheered me up, <span class="smcap">He</span>. Good-bye. [<i>At the door</i>] You shall get a note
to-morrow.</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">The Bareback Rider</span></p>

<p>[<i>Laughing</i>]: A jolly fellow, sir. You wanted to see him? There he is.
<span class="smcap">He</span>, the gentleman wants to see you.</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">He</span></p>

<p>[<i>In a depressed voice</i>]: What can I do for you?</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="hang">[<i>The actor bows, and goes away, smiling. Both men take a step

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Gentleman</span></p>

<p>Is this you?</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">He</span></p>

<p>Yes! It is I. And you? [<i>Silence.</i>]</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Gentleman</span></p>

<p>Must I believe my eyes? Is this <i>you</i>, Mr.——<a name="page_094" id="page_094"></a></p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">He</span></p>

<p>[<i>In a rage</i>]: My name here is <span class="smcap">He</span>. I have no other name, do you hear? <span class="smcap">He</span>
Who Gets Slapped. And if you want to stay here, don't forget it.</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Gentleman</span></p>

<p>You are so familiar. As far as I can remember——</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">He</span></p>

<p>We are all familiar, here. [<i>Contemptuously</i>] Besides, that's all you
deserve, anywhere.</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Gentleman</span></p>

<p>[<i>Humbly</i>]: You have not forgiven me, <span class="smcap">He</span>? [<i>Silence.</i>]</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">He</span></p>

<p>Are you here with my wife? Is she, too, in the circus?</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Gentleman</span></p>

<p>[<i>Quickly</i>]: Oh, no! I am alone. She stayed there!</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">He</span></p>

<p>You've left her already?<a name="page_095" id="page_095"></a></p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Gentleman</span></p>

<p>[<i>Humbly</i>]: No—we have—a son. After your sudden and mysterious
disappearance—when you left that strange and insulting letter——</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">He</span></p>

<p>[<i>Laughs</i>]: Insulting? You are still able to feel insults? What are you
doing here? Were you looking for me, or is it an accident?</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Gentleman</span></p>

<p>I have been looking for you, for half a year—through many countries.
And suddenly, to-day—by accident, indeed—I had no acquaintances here,
and I went to the circus. We must talk things over ... <span class="smcap">He</span>, I implore
you. [<i>Silence.</i>]</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">He</span></p>

<p>Here is a shadow I cannot lose! To talk things over! Do you really think
we still have something to talk over? All right. Leave your address with
the porter, and I will let you know when you can see me. Now get out.
[<i>Proudly.</i>] I am busy.</p>
