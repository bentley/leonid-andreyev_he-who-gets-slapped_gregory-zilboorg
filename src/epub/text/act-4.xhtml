<p><i>Music in the ring. More disorder in the room than usual. All kinds of
actors' costumes hanging on pegs and lying in the corners. On the table
a bouquet of fiery-red roses, put there by some careless hand. At the
entrance, near the arch, three bareback riders are smoking and
chattering; they are all minor actors. All part their hair the same way;
two wear small moustaches; the third one is clean-shaven with a face
like a bull-dog.</i></p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">The Clean-shaven One</span></p>

<p>Go on, Henry! Ten thousand francs! It's too much even for the Baron.</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">The Second</span></p>

<p>How much are roses now?</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">The Shaven</span></p>

<p>I don't know. In winter they are certainly more expensive, but still
Henry talks nonsense. Ten thousand!<a name="page_146" id="page_146"></a></p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">The Second</span></p>

<p>The Baron has his own hothouse. They don't cost him anything.</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Henry</span></p>

<p>[<i>Throwing away hit cigar, which has burned the tips of his fingers</i>]:
No, Grab, you're silly. There's a whole car-load full! One can smell the
roses a mile away. They're to cover the entire arena.</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">The Shaven</span></p>

<p>Only the ring.</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Henry</span></p>

<p>It's all the same. In order to cover the ring, you must have thousands
and thousands of roses. You'll see what it looks like, when they've
covered everything like a carpet. He ordered them to make it like a
carpet! Do you see, Grab?</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">The Second</span></p>

<p>What a Baron's craze! Isn't it time yet?</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Henry</span></p>

<p>No, we have time enough. I rather like it: a fiery-red tango on a
fiery-red cover of winter roses!<a name="page_147" id="page_147"></a></p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">The Shaven</span></p>

<p>Consuelo will be galloping on roses. And Bezano?</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">The Second</span></p>

<p>And Bezano on thorns. [<i>Smiles.</i>]</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">The Shaven</span></p>

<p>That youngster has no self-respect. I'd have refused.</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Henry</span></p>

<p>But it is his job. He's got to do it. [<i>Laughs.</i>] Talk to him about
self-respect. He's as angry and proud as a little Satan.</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">The Second</span></p>

<p>No, you may say what you like, it's an excellent benefit performance.
It's a joy to look at the crowd. They're so excited.</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Henry</span></p>

<p>Tss! [<i>All throw away their cigars and cigarettes, like school boys who
are caught, and make way for</i> <span class="smcap">Zinida</span>, <i>who enters with</i> <span class="smcap">He</span>.]<a name="page_148" id="page_148"></a></p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Zinida</span></p>

<p>What are you doing here, gentlemen? Your place is at the entrance.</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Henry</span></p>

<p>[<i>With a respectful smile</i>]: We are here just for a minute, Madame
Zinida. We are going. What a successful evening! And what a glory for
Papa Briquet!</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Zinida</span></p>

<p>Yes. Go, and please don't leave your places. [<i>They go.</i> <span class="smcap">Zinida</span> <i>pulls a
drawer out of the desk, and puts in some papers. She is in her lion
tamer's costume.</i>] <span class="smcap">He</span>, what were you doing near my lions? You frightened
me.</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">He</span></p>

<p>Why, Duchess, I merely wanted to hear what the beasts were saying about
the benefit performance. They are pacing in their cages, and growling.</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Zinida</span></p>

<p>The music makes them nervous. Sit down, <span class="smcap">He</span>. An excellent evening, and I
am so glad that Consuelo is leaving us. Have you heard about the Baron's
roses.<a name="page_149" id="page_149"></a></p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">He</span></p>

<p>Everybody is talking about them. The Hymeneal roses!</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Zinida</span></p>

<p>Here are some, too. [<i>Pushes away the bouquet.</i>] You find them
everywhere. Yes, I am glad. She is superfluous here, and disturbs our
work. It is a misfortune for a cast to have in it such a beautiful and
such an ... accessible girl.</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">He</span></p>

<p>But it is an honest marriage, Duchess, is it not?</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Zinida</span></p>

<p>I don't care what it is.</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">He</span></p>

<p>Spiders, too need an improvement in their breed! Can't you imagine,
Zinida, what charming little spiders this couple will create! They will
have the face of their mother, Consuelo, and the stomach of their
father, the Baron, and thus could be an ornament for any circus-ring.</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Zinida</span></p>

<p>You are malicious to-day, <span class="smcap">He</span>. You are morose.<a name="page_150" id="page_150"></a></p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">He</span></p>

<p>I laugh.</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Zinida</span></p>

<p>You do, but without joy. Why are you without make-up?</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">He</span></p>

<p>I am in the third act. I have time. And how does Bezano feel about this
evening. Is he glad?</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Zinida</span></p>

<p>I didn't talk to Bezano. You know what I think, my friend? You, too, are
superfluous here. [<i>Silence.</i>]</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">He</span></p>

<p>How do you want me to take that, Zinida?</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Zinida</span></p>

<p>Just as I said. In fact, Consuelo sold herself for nothing. What is the
Baron worth, with his poor millions? People say that you are clever, too
clever perhaps; tell me then, for how much could one buy me?<a name="page_151" id="page_151"></a></p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">He</span></p>

<p>[<i>Looking as if he were pricing her</i>]: Only for a crown.</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Zinida</span></p>

<p>A baron's crown?</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">He</span></p>

<p>No, a royal one.</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Zinida</span></p>

<p>You are far from being stupid. And you guessed that Consuelo is not
Mancini's daughter?</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">He</span></p>

<p>[<i>Startled</i>]: What! And she knows it?</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Zinida</span></p>

<p>Hardly. Why should she know it? Yes, she is a girl from Corsica whose
parents are unknown. He preferred to use her for business rather
than.... But according to the law, she is his daughter, Countess
Veronica Mancini.</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">He</span></p>

<p>It is nice, to have everything done according to law, isn't it, Zinida?
But it is curious there is more<a name="page_152" id="page_152"></a> blue blood in her than in this Mancini.
One would say that it was she who found him on the street, and made him
a count and her father. Count Mancini! [<i>Laughs.</i>]</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Zinida</span></p>

<p>Yes, you are gloomy, <span class="smcap">He</span>. I changed my mind, you'd better stay.</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">He</span></p>

<p>Will I not be superfluous?</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Zinida</span></p>

<p>When she is gone, you will not. Oh! You don't know yet, how nice it is
to be with us. What a rest for the body and mind. I understand you. I am
clever, too. Like you, I brought with me from out there my inclination
for chains, and for a long time I chained myself to whatever I could, in
order to feel firm.</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">He</span></p>

<p>Bezano?</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Zinida</span></p>

<p>Bezano and others; there were many, there will be many more. My red
lion, with whom I am desperately<a name="page_153" id="page_153"></a> in love, is still more terrible than
Bezano. But it is all nonsense; old habits, which we are sorry to let
go, like old servants who steal things. Leave Consuelo alone. She has
her own way.</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">He</span></p>

<p>Automobiles and diamonds?</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Zinida</span></p>

<p>When did you see a beauty clad in simple cotton? If this one does not
buy her, another will. They buy off everything that is beautiful. Yes, I
know. For the first ten years she will be a sad beauty, who will attract
the eyes of the poor man on the side-walk: afterward she will begin to
paint a little around her eyes and smile, and then will take——</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">He</span></p>

<p>Her <i>chauffeur</i> or butler as a lover? You're not guessing badly, Zinida!</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Zinida</span></p>

<p>Am I not right? I don't want to intrude on your confidence, but to-day I
am sorry for you, <span class="smcap">He</span>. What can you do against Fate? Don't be offended,
my friend, by the words of a woman. I like you; you<a name="page_154" id="page_154"></a> are not beautiful,
nor young, nor rich, and your place is——</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">He</span></p>

<p>On the side-walk, from which one looks at the beauties. [<i>Laughs.</i>] And
if I don't want to?</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Zinida</span></p>

<p>What does it matter, your "want" or "don't want"? I am sorry for you, my
poor friend, but if you are a strong man, and I think you are, then
there is only one way for you. To forget.</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">He</span></p>

<p>You think that that's being strong? And you are saying this, you, Queen
Zinida, who want to awaken the feeling of love, even in the heart of a
lion? For one second of an illusory possession, you are ready to pay
with your life, and still you advise me to forget! Give me your strong
hand, my beautiful lady; see how much strength there is in this
pressure, and don't pity me.</p>

<p>[<i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Briquet</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Mancini</span>. <i>The latter it reserved, and
self-consciously imposing. He has a new suit, but the same cane, and the
same noiseless smile of a satyr.</i>]<a name="page_155" id="page_155"></a></p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Zinida</span></p>

<p>[<i>Whispering</i>]: Will you stay?</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">He</span></p>

<p>Yes. I shan't go away.</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Mancini</span></p>

<p>How are you, my dear? But you are dazzling, my dear! I swear you are
marvellous! Your lion would be an ass, if he did not kiss your hand, as
I do.... [<i>Kisses her hand.</i>]</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Zinida</span></p>

<p>May I congratulate you, Count?</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Mancini</span></p>

<p>Yes, merci. [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">He</span>]: How are you, my dear?</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">He</span></p>

<p>Good evening, Count!</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Briquet</span></p>

<p>Zinida, the Count wants to pay immediately for the breach of contract
with Consuelo ... the Countess's contract. Don't you remember, Mother,
how much it is?<a name="page_156" id="page_156"></a></p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Zinida</span></p>

<p>I'll look it up, Papa.</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Mancini</span></p>

<p>Yes, please. Consuelo will not return here any more. We leave to-morrow.</p>

<p>[<span class="smcap">Zinida</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Briquet</span> <i>search among the papers</i>. <span class="smcap">He</span> <i>takes</i> <span class="smcap">Mancini</span>
<i>roughly by the elbow, and draws him aside.</i>]</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">He</span></p>

<p>[<i>In a low voice</i>]: How are your girls, Mancini?</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Mancini</span></p>

<p>What girls? What is this, stupidity or blackmail? Look out, sir, be
careful, the policeman is not far.</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">He</span></p>

<p>You are much too severe, Mancini. I assumed, that since we are
<i>tête-á-tête</i>....</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Mancini</span></p>

<p>But tell me, what kind of <i>tête-á-tête</i> is possible, between a clown and
me? [<i>Laughs.</i>] You are stupid, <span class="smcap">He</span>. You should say what you want, and
not ask questions!<a name="page_157" id="page_157"></a></p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Briquet</span></p>

<p>Three thousand francs, Count.</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Mancini</span></p>

<p>Is that all? For Consuelo? All right. I'll tell the Baron.</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Zinida</span></p>

<p>You took——</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Briquet</span></p>

<p>Don't, Mother, don't.</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Zinida</span></p>

<p>Count, you drew in advance, I have it written down, eighty francs and
twenty centimes. Will you pay this money, too?</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Mancini</span></p>

<p>Certainly, certainly. You will get three thousand and one hundred.
[<i>Laughing</i>] Twenty centimes! I never thought I could be so accurate.
[<i>Seriously</i>] Yes, my friends. My daughter Consuelo—the Countess—and
the Baron, expressed their desire to bid farewell to the whole cast.<a name="page_158" id="page_158"></a></p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">He</span></p>

<p>The Baron, too?</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Mancini</span></p>

<p>Yes, Auguste, too. They want to do it during the intermission.
Therefore, I ask you to gather here ... the more decent ones ... but
please don't make it too crowded! <span class="smcap">He</span>, will you, sir, be kind enough to
run into the buffet and tell them to bring right away a basket of
champagne, bottles and glasses—you understand?</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">He</span></p>

<p>Yes, Count.</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Mancini</span></p>

<p>Wait a minute, what's the hurry—what is this, a new costume? You are
all burning like the devils in hell!</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">He</span></p>

<p>You do me too much honour, Count, I am not a devil. I am merely a poor
sinner who the devils are frying a little. [<i>He goes out, bowing like a
clown.</i>]</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Mancini</span></p>

<p>A gifted chap, but too cunning.<a name="page_159" id="page_159"></a></p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Briquet</span></p>

<p>It's the Tango colour, in honour of your daughter, Count. He needs it
for a new stunt, which he doesn't want to tell in advance. Don't you
want to sit down, Count?</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Mancini</span></p>

<p>Auguste is waiting for me, but ... it's all right. [<i>Takes a seat.</i>]
Nevertheless I am sorry to leave you, my friend. High society,
certainly, prerogatives of the title, castles of exalted noblemen, but
where could I find such freedom, and ... such simplicity.... And
besides, these announcements, these burning posters, which take your
breath in the morning, they had something which summoned, which
encouraged.... <i>There</i>, my friends, I shall become old.</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Briquet</span></p>

<p>But pleasures of a higher kind, Count. Why are you silent, Zinida?</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Zinida</span></p>

<p>I'm listening.</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Mancini</span></p>

<p>By the way, my dear, how do you like my suit?<a name="page_160" id="page_160"></a> You have wonderful taste.
[<i>Spreads out his lace tie and lace cuffs.</i>]</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Zinida</span></p>

<p>I like it. You look like a nobleman of the courts of long ago.</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Mancini</span></p>

<p>Yes? But don't you think it is too conspicuous? Who wears lace and satin
now? This dirty democracy will soon make us dress ourselves in sack
cloth. [<i>With a sigh</i>] Auguste told me that this jabot was out of place.</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Zinida</span></p>

<p>The Baron is too severe.</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Mancini</span></p>

<p>Yes, but it seems to me he is right. I am a little infected with your
fancy. [<span class="smcap">He</span> <i>returns. Two waiters follow him, carrying a basket of
champagne and glasses. They prepare everything on the table.</i>]</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Mancini</span></p>

<p>Ah! <i>merci</i>, <span class="smcap">He</span>. But, please, none of this bourgeoise exploding of
corks; be slower and more modest. Send the bill to Baron Regnard. Then,
we will be here, Briquet. I must go.<a name="page_161" id="page_161"></a></p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Zinida</span></p>

<p>[<i>Looks at her watch</i>]: Yes, the act is going to end soon.</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Mancini</span></p>

<p>The devil take him!</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Zinida</span></p>

<p>[<i>Pointing to the waiter</i>]: Not so loud, Louis!</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Briquet</span></p>

<p>No! The devil take him! And why couldn't you help me, Mother? You left
me alone to talk to him. High Society! High pleasures! Swindler! [<span class="smcap">He</span>
<i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Zinida</span> <i>laugh. The waiters smile.</i>]</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Briquet</span></p>

<p>[<i>To the waiters</i>]: What are you laughing about? You can go. We will
help ourselves. Whiskey and soda, Jean! [<i>In a low and angry voice</i>]
Champagne! [<i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>, <i>in his clown's costume.</i>]<a name="page_162" id="page_162"></a></p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Jackson</span></p>

<p>A whiskey and soda for me, too! At least I hear some laughter here.
Those idiots have simply forgotten how to laugh. My sun was rising and
setting and crawling all over the ring—— and not a smile! Look at my
bottom, shines like a mirror! [<i>Turns around quickly.</i>] Beg your pardon,
Zinida. And you don't look badly to-night, <span class="smcap">He</span>. Look out for your cheeks.
I hate beauties.</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Briquet</span></p>

<p>A benefit performance crowd!</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Jackson</span></p>

<p>[<i>Looking in a hand mirror, correcting his make-up</i>]: In the orchestra
there are some Barons and Egyptian mummies. I got a belly-ache from
fright. I am an honest clown. I can't stand it when they look at me as
if I had stolen a handkerchief. <span class="smcap">He</span>, please give them a good many slaps
to-night.</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">He</span></p>

<p>Be quiet, Jim. I shall avenge you. [<i><span class="smcap">He</span> goes out.</i>]</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Zinida</span></p>

<p>And how is Bezano?<a name="page_163" id="page_163"></a></p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Jackson</span></p>

<p>[<i>Grumbling</i>]: Bezano! A crazy success. But he is crazy, he will break
his neck to-morrow. Why does he run such a risk? Or perhaps he has
wings, like a god? Devil take it. It's disgusting to look at him. It's
not work any more.</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Briquet</span></p>

<p>You are right, Jim! It is not work any more. To your health, old
comrade, Jackson.</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Jackson</span></p>

<p>To yours, Louis.</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Briquet</span></p>

<p>It is not work any more, since these Barons came here! Do you hear? They
are laughing. But I am indignant, I am indignant, Jim! What do they want
here, these Barons? Let them steal hens in other hen roosts, and leave
us in peace. Ah! Had I been Secretary of the Interior, I should have
made an iron fence between us and those people.</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Jackson</span></p>

<p>I am very sorry myself for our dear little Consuelo. I don't know why,
but it seems to me that we<a name="page_164" id="page_164"></a> all look to-day more like swindlers than
honest artists. Don't you think so, Zinida?</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Zinida</span></p>

<p>Everybody does what he wants. It's Consuelo's business and her father's.</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Briquet</span></p>

<p>No, Mother, that's not true! Not everybody does what he wants, but it
turns out this way ... devil knows why.</p>
